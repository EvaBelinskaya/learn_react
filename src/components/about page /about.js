            Mindfulness is the ability to be aware of
            what is happening in the present
            moment,without any judgement.It is a
            basic human ability that everyone has,
            that we can cultivate and train by prac-
            tice.During mindfulness exercises,we
            are invited to pay attention to thoughts,
            sounds,smell,observations,emotions,
            parts of the body or the sensations of
            breathing, and to bring our attention
            back to the object of focus whenever the
            mind starts to wander.Another form of
            exercise is not using a specific focus yet
            training to stay aware of where the at-
            tention moves to.A third group of exer-
            cises are often called 'informal exercis-
            es':we train ourselves by paying more
            attention to specific actions, situations
            and interactions in our daily lives.For
            example, we drink tea, brush our hair, or
            walk to the next room with our full
            awareness.

            With guidance and training, mindfulness
            can develop into a way of living that
            brings greater focus and effectiveness as
            well as kindness and caring in everything
            we do.

            Childhood is an important formative and
            developmental stage that lays the foun-
            dation for well-being and mental health
            in later years and adulthood.The
            number of school-based programmes
            that aim to promote well-being and
            mindfulness, support emotional and
            social learning and prevent mental
            health problems in adulthood,is growing.

        <div className={styles.content1}>
            Arts and Mindfulness in Education
            (A.M.i.E.) is an international project, imple-
            mented in partnership with the Erasmus+
            programme. The aim of the project is to
            provide teachers worldwide with inspira-
            tional, innovative and supportive tools
            aiding the integration of mindfulness in
            primary and pre-primary curricula in an
            easy, fun and sustainable way.

            The unique feature of the A.M.i.E. project
            is the fact that it uses the power of the
            arts and creative processes to cultivate
            mindfulness in primary and pre-primary
            school environments.

            The name "Calminder" shows the different
            elements of the project.You can recognize
            the words:calendar, mind and calm,
            which all are related to mindfulness and
            the A.M.i.E. project itself.

            Calminder is an innovative and interactive
            web-based application that serves as an
            inspirational tool for teachers in pre-pri-
            mary and primary education for introduc-
            ing mindfulness through arts in their daily
            educational contexts in the form of a
            weekly calendar containing 'ready-to-go'
            exercises.

            Interdisciplinary and internationally com-
            posed student teams developed this
            multi-year-based project website under
            the guidance of Irma Smegen, founder of
            the company Speel je wijs.Mindfulness
            training sessions were held with the stu-
            dents, for a more in-depth perspective
            about how mindfulness works. These
            trainings were guided by specialised
            mindfulness trainers.

            More information, tools and exercises can
            be found in Irma Smegen's books which
            will be published the coming years.
